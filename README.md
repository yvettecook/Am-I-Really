End of Week 7 refresher on:

* Setting up a simple NodeJS application with Express
* Testing it with Mocha, Chai and Zombie

### Spec:

I'm going to recreate one of my favourite websites - [amiafuckingfeminist.com](www.amiafuckingfeminist.com)

Nothing fancy, nothing whizzy, just a straight-forward question with a straight-forward answer (hopefully with some straight-forward code behind it).

### Tools:

 * Coffee-script: 1.8.0
 * ejs: 1.0.0
 * Express: 4.10.1
 * Chai: 1.9.2
 * Mocha: 2.0.1
 * Zombie: 2.1.1
